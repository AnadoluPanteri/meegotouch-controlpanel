1. What is a Dcp Applet?

    A DuiControlPanel (Dcp) applet is a library that can be launched from
the cotrol panel and can set some things, like language, display settings, etc.
It has a category specified in its desktop file (see 6.) and according this
category, the control panel puts launch widget to it on its corresponding page.
For example the category of Language Applet is "Region settings"

2. Requirements of developing DcpApplet

   You need to install libduicontrolpanel-dev to develop Dcp Applets

3. Architecture

3.1 
    When launching an applet, DuiControlpanel displays it on one special page,
    that provides title, menu, and back-mechanism which is handled internally,
    so applet developers has nothing to do with it.
    Thus, applet has not pages but widgets. Each widget is displayed on this
    special page as the main widget, so it looks like that each widget is a
    new "page view" of an applet.  
    Changing widgets ("page view" of an applet) can be done with requesting it
    with a signal, and going back can be provided by setting a referer.
    To provide this mechanism, widgets must be inherited by DcpWidget, which is
    a DuiWidget descendant with a few services:

    - it can request changing to another widget by emitting
      changeWidget(int widgetId), where widgetId is the id of another widget, 
      defined by the applet itself (see later)
    - it can set a widget as a referer, eg. where to go back, when user presses
      'Back' button on the control panel page. When the referer is -1, it means 
      that you are on the main view of the applet, and 'Back' buttos should close 
      the applet and go back to the applet category page of the DuiControlPanel.
 
    Each applet must implement DcpAppletIf interface, which provide
