    - constructWidget() that creates the applet GUI
    - title() returns the title of the applet
    - viewMenuItems() that returns menu items can be appended to main menu of 
      the application which has loaded the applet
    - constructBrief() returns DcpBrief class that contains all the

      aka applet buttons in category page of DuiControlPanel.

Applet metadata

  DcpAppletMetadata class provides common informations of an applet itself.
It is constructed from desktop file. It has
several virtual functions like name(), fileName(), fullBinary(),
category() can come directly from desktop file but it has functions like 
text1(), text2() /the first and second row of applet mini view/,
widgetTypeID() /simple label, double label, image, etc/ that can come from 
the Brief of the applet. The mini view can be easily construced from these data
using DcpButtons.

It has a widget type (one label, two rows, two rows with image, etc)
it has methods like:
- void setText(QString text1, QString text2) for the two rows
- void setLine(bool line) - sets/unsets separator line on the bottof
- void setAlignment(Qt::Alignment alignment) 
- it has a clicked() signal
